# Boundary Dash

A simple game where the player moves a square (character) within a defined boundary. The player uses arrow keys to move the character, and the game ends if the character collides with the boundary.

Added a scoring mechanism: +1 for every 'legal' move, ie a move that doesn't result in a collission with the boundary wall.

I made this while doing the programming exercises of **_Chapter 4: Objects and Graphics_** from the book **_Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science_** by John Zelle. I used the _graphics_ module which was specifically written for the chapter.

The graphics module is available [here](https://pypi.org/project/graphics.py/), and can be easily installed using the `pip` command, viz. `pip install graphics`.
